# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code used the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but a different JavaScript solutionwas used to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. 

# User Story
